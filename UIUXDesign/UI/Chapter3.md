# Conversion and action elements

## Sales and marketing 101
Does the thought of selling something send shivers down your spine?

Then you might think marketing is all about sleazy sales tricks, and that it takes a special kind of personality—one you certainly are not, being a creative introvert.

All these are common misconceptions.

**Marketing is another solid craft, just like design or development.** The essence of it is making the perfect match between the buyer and the seller.

“**Marketing** is communicating the value of a product, service or brand to customers, for the purpose of promoting or selling that product, service, or brand.
**A sale** is the exchange of a commodity for money or service in return for money.
Marketing and sales differ greatly, but have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in Marketing, which also includes Pricing, Promotion, Place and Product (the 4 P's).” – Wikipedia

**A marketer is merely facilitating the sales process** by informing all the parties and reducing the friction—all done at the right time in the right place. As a designer, you can certainly participate in this process.

 
## Why you need marketing
So does a UI designer need to know marketing? Absolutely.

You don't have to plan and run intricate ad campaigns. But the basics of marketing are essential.

You might think that creating a great product is the biggest challenge for any business. That's partially true: it's hard to nail down a product concept. But it's even harder to craft the application itself, launch it, and deal with support issues.

For any entrepreneur, the core challenge is making sales. Healthy cash flow is the oxygen of a business. It doesn't matter if the product is spectacular—the business dies if nobody buys it.

As a UI designer, you don't have to sell anything yourself. But you want to keep your head turned in the same direction your client's looking. And trust me, your client thinks about sales a lot.

**The majority of designers manage to live without having a single idea about marketing.** So any effort in this direction will be greatly appreciated by your clients. It’ll set you apart from your competitors.

## The core ideas of marketing
Here are the most important marketing ideas you should understand.

The first one: **we sell products based on benefits, not features**.

Designers, developers, and other craftsmen are often guilty of the opposite. We know all the features inside out because we created them, and we want to share this knowledge with the world.

An example: seamless integration with Dropbox is an individual feature that doesn't really matter to the user. What matters is the user’s professional reputation and whether they’ll be able to ship their work on time even after a hard drive crash, because the files are safely and automatically backed up to the cloud. That's a clear benefit.

Your goal: develop a product that helps the user feel good by completing their tasks. It's 10 times more important than making yourself feel good about cool features.

The second one: **best-selling products relieve a user’s existing harsh pain**.

If we compare products to drugs, we can classify them in 2 groups: painkillers and vitamins. Your product should relieve a single pain very well, without overwhelming the user with an endless number of cool features. Your client will use this pain to market the product effectively.

## Keeping conversion in mind
Here's a short list of terms you should know. Knowing them will help you feel at home in any marketing conversation.

* **Call-to-action (CTA)**: an interactive element (button or link) that represents immediate action for the user
* **Conversion**: an act of turning page visitors into customers, which is highly desired in marketing
* **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)**: a discipline that focuses on improving the user experience to increase the conversion rate. Common CRO methods include data analysis and testing of suggested hypothetical improvements.

Now that we know the goals of marketing, let's see what visual instruments can help us drive a user's behavior.

## Driving behavior with visual cues

Your goal is to drive users’ behavior, and sales is the most obvious reason for doing this. But when it comes to in-app interaction, our motives can be much more intricate.

Here's why you'd want to drive the user to do a certain action:

* To reduce friction while performing common tasks
* To make sure the user reacts in critical situations when action is required (alerts and notifications)
* To avoid destructive actions performed by mistake (deleting entries or losing unsaved data)
* To improve user onboarding experience
* To facilitate in-app conversion, like sign-ups and plan upgrades

Actual sales and conversion only take up a minor part of such cases, but the visual cues that reinforce the actions are the same. They're used on marketing pages to boost sales, and they're used inside the app to serve the user's own needs.

“Your product’s most essential features should be its most obvious. Your product’s utility should be evident to people of every experience level.” – Nick Disabato, Cadence & Slang

## Directional cues
**Linear layout** is the best way to make the user consume information or do something just the way we want. Simple linear order is the most powerful way to control the sequence of events. They can be aligned in a single long scrollable area, or split into a series of smaller edible screens.

Make sure there are no distractions along the way. Sidebars and external links add visual interest, but they also distract the user from his main intention.

To facilitate that sequence, we use various **arrows and pointers**. They guide the eyesight and indicate possible action. You can either include an arrow in a call-to-action (like a button), or draw an external arrow that points to it. Such arrows became infamous in sales page design, but they've been overused for a single reason: they work very well.

**People's faces** work even better than the most prominent arrow. Whenever you use a photo or an illustration of a human face, it naturally draws attention like a magnet.

Can you see what that person is looking at? Most likely, 95% of your users are looking at the same spot. It's rather unlikely that you'll be using large faces inside your app, but it's certainly a great fact to know.

Whenever you're placing a UI element, consider positioning it in **the most common location**:

* The first button in a row usually denotes a positive, harmless response
* The “close” button is usually positioned in the top right corner
* The top area of the page serves for navigation controls and urgent notifications

Most users have developed solid habits while using other apps. Key controls in unusual areas make them break these habits and give additional thought to routine actions. You certainly don't want that friction in your user experience.

## Color and size
Both color and size are strong properties. They allow the user to judge the importance—and even the meaning—of any interface element. Create **a clear visual hierarchy** using these properties.

The brightest, most contrasting color draws the most attention. Used in moderation, it instantly drives interest, like flowers attract bees.

**Traditional color coding** remains important. Green means safe and positive, red means dangerous and urgent, gray means inactive.

The biggest, brightest button has the best chances of being clicked, no matter what the label says. Make sure this button doesn't trigger any destructive action. It should link to the most common and natural action, like saving data.

Whenever you have a row of buttons, highlight the most suitable choice for the user. Make the “Save” button large and green, and the “Cancel” button small and gray.

## Alerts and notifications
**Alerts should always get special design treatment.** You don't want your user to miss incoming messages or new leads.

Some advice:

* Place your alerts close to the navigation area
* Don't rely on a single method to make the alert stand out—use a combination of 2 or more, like a numeral and a vivid color or a color and a prominent animation
* If possible, include an immediate call-to-action inside the message to reduce the number of clicks to commit the desired action
* Use several levels of urgency: after a few regular appearances, the most critical alerts can appear in a modal popup that strictly demands for action—just don't overuse them
* Somewhere nearby, give your user a shortcut to disable notifications

## Verbal cues
Technically speaking, button text and other labels don't qualify as visual clues. However, the way we label our calls to action is important. You most likely won't have a conversion-rate-optimized (CRO) copywriter around to tell you how to name your buttons.

* Use common words: don't try to be intricate or humorous with your key CTAs. Continue is better than Onward.
* Use verbs that clearly communicate what the user's going to do
* Make sure the user understands what will happen after they click that button and where they will end up

Always provide explanatory, encouraging micro-comments—the user wants to rest assured that their work will be safe. Anything unpredictable can easily kill the joy in user experience. Remember: safety first, creativity second.

Now that you're in the know about sales and marketing and how to drive behavior with visual clues, you're ready to move on to learning about the creative part of UI design. And it just so happens that we'll cover that in the next chapter.
