# What's a product designer?

Well—you are. Or you’re about to become one.

And you’re a part of something big: a design renaissance. The rise of the product designer.

Because **design is the new language of business**. “Software is eating the world.” Technology isn’t the differentiator that it used to be. Startup costs have dropped near zero, lowering the barrier to new entrants. Companies can now operate at scale in single domains, entirely in code.

And all that means that the product and its experience have become the major differentiators. **Code’s easy to replicate. A superior experience is not.** A product’s design—how it meets human needs, how it brings delight, and how it works, both behind the scenes and on stage—has never been more in the spotlight.

So what does that mean for the designer, the one whose job used to just be to “make it pretty?”

It means that you now lead the charge. For the customer. For the experience. For the brand. *For the business.*

Geoff Teehan put it like this: “This is a most amazing time to be a designer. It’s the golden age, we just don’t know it yet. In some cases, you can work directly with people like Ev, Zuck and the like. That’s pretty insane.”

So, you want to design the product of the future? You’d better know your design history.

Because the role of product designer was born in a typewritten memo from 1931, penned by a manager at Procter & Gamble, who would later become Secretary of Defense and create NASA.

Don’t buy it? Let me take you back.

It’s May 1931. Cincinnati, Ohio. Neil McElroy is responsible for growing sales for the Camay soap brand, and it’s not going well. Camay’s in danger of being overshadowed by P&G’s Ivory soap.

McElroy realizes that the way his organization has an old-fashioned structure. So he sits down in front of his Royal Typewriter and taps out a proposal that would impact industries that didn’t even exist yet. His proposal: **the brand man**.

The brand man was a novel idea at the time. Companies like P&G hired people for specific business functions such as, say, sales or research or administration.

But the brand man—and later, **brand manager**—would be tasked with guiding a product to success. He’d seek to understand which processes worked and which didn’t, trying “to apply this same treatment to other territories that are comparable.” And he’d go into the field to measure results, reporting back with data to tweak their approach.

Soon, P&G would reorganize their company around this newly invented role, and McElroy would take over the company. Competitors around the world copied them.

McElroy couldn’t have foreseen his role in creating the concept of product management in software. But it was a former P&G brand manager who would introduce this concept to software in 1981: Scott Cook, founder of Intuit. Their first product was Quicken. You may have heard of it.

Now, in 2015, we’re witnessing the rise of product design. And the product designer stands on the shoulders of the product manager. So to really understand what’s up with product design, we first need to understand how the product manager came to be.

Rewind to the 1980s. Software companies were on the rise. As new product development got more complicated and engineers ran out of bandwidth, usability tended to suffer. On top of that, products were becoming more and more consumer-oriented.

Scott Cook was one of the first to implement brand management–like principles at a tech company. From day 1, he sought to observe customer needs and solve them with a product.

Other companies, like Microsoft, came at product development from a different direction. They realized, in Joel Spolsky’s words, that:

*“The marketing team was ranting and raving about customer needs and nobody had time to talk to them or translate their MBA-speak into actual features. There was a lot of product design stuff that took a lot of work: talking to users, running usability tests, reviewing competitive products, and thinking hard about how to make things easier, and most programmers just didn’t have the time (nor were they particularly good at it).”*

Microsoft decided to fill the gap, and named the role, “**program manager**”.

That was the 1980s. Flash forward 30 years and we have a new term: product designer. So what’s the difference?

The product designer blends aspects of a product manager and a designer. **Product management as we know it is shifting into the realm of the designer.**

In other words, a product designer bears responsibility for 2 broad tasks:

1. Identifying the opportunity for a new product in a customer’s life
2. Bringing that product into existence

Why has this happened?

As noted earlier, **design has become a significant competitive advantage**. To realize that advantage, companies need people who understand the customer, the problems they face, and how the product can help them overcome those problems. Then, that understanding needs to be synthesized, visualized, and designed into a solution. And someone has to choreograph the epic process of bringing that solution to light, ensuring the effective collaboration of folks from a host of disciplines, including writing, web dev, engineering, marketing, and more.

Of course, like most roles in the tech world, a product designer’s responsibilities will shift slightly with every new company and challenge. In some places, product designers might need to learn to write code to bring a product to life. In others, a deep understanding of a customer’s psychology is a critical ingredient.

But wherever they call home, **product designers work to close the gap between developer and customer**.

**The customer is who the product designer really works for.** And in our next chapter, that’s exactly who we’re going to examine.

## Praxis
History and theory are nice and all, but they fade quickly without practice. Moving forward, at the end of every lesson we’ll highlight 3 action items you can apply to your design process *right now*. Because your time is precious.
