# This is the new design process

Let’s talk about the realities of product design today. By rewinding to World War II.

If you know anything about Winston Churchill, you know he was armed with an incredibly strong personality that, at times, intimidated those who worked for him. But he was also impressively self-aware.

Churchill became so concerned that this would prevent his staff from delivering bad news that he created an organization outside the normal chain of command called the Statistical Office. Its job? To deliver uncompromising, unfiltered news and facts about the war effort.

Churchill relied on the Statistical Office to help him make every important decision during the war. Under civilian leadership, it tracked essential areas like aircraft production and losses, munitions production, and import/export balances. So even though he was known for his grand vision of Britain winning the war, Churchill operated under the premise that “facts are better than dreams.”

**Products must create customers to exist.** But how do you know what your customers need? How do you know which pains are significant enough to build a product or feature for?

**To become a product designer, you have to be like Churchill.** You have to know your facts and do the hard work to find them. You have to:

1. Determine who your product serves—or could serve
2. Study current and potential customers in their natural habitats to find out what they need, want, and might be ready to buy
3. Build products and features that speak to those needs and wants

Do all that, and you’ll “see around the next corner” (as Steve Jobs used to say), and build successful businesses.

In part 1, we talked about Scott Cook, founder of Intuit. He brought his experience as a brand manager at Procter & Gamble into his new company because he wanted to build a software company that actually understood its customers.

Cook unknowingly pioneered a new practice within the software industry: the “follow me home” program. The former Crisco brand manager knew he wouldn’t be satisfied creating software simply to ship it. He wanted it to be easy to use for people who weren’t computer scientists or trained accountants.

So he sent Intuit staff members home with real, first-time customers! They watched as customers installed the software and got started with it. They observed their customers’ workflows and the environments they used the product in.

These days, you can conduct field studies like this online. It’s easy to identify where customers hang out on the web—forums, social networks, etc.—and observe them there. **Observing your customers helps you understand the contexts they might use your product in**, and how these contexts might affect the value of your product in their daily lives.
 
In fact, field studies have been used to answer burning tech questions like:

* Should a chipmaker for enterprise servers enter the consumer PC business?
* How do employees change their behavior in Fortune 500 companies when their manager is present versus when he is not?
* Are baby boomers keeping their PCs and TVs as they get older, or are they shifting usage to mobile devices with different form factors?

## A new product creation model
But **finding and analyzing an audience’s pain is just the start of the product creation process**.

It’s like bringing a blurry image into focus with an analog lens. Your subject’s right there in front of you, but you’re not sure which zoom setting will bring your subject into focus. So you turn the zoom ring back and forth, gradually settling on the zoom that’s right for the lens and the photo.

Of course, the subject or background could be moving right before your eyes. Smiles and facial expressions, leaves blowing in the wind, wildlife running out of frame. So you strive to capture the best possible story in 1 frame, adapting to the realities on the ground.

Building a product poses similar challenges. Once you’ve identified your audience and the pain you’ll solve for them, you’ll have a clear goal—but you’ll probably have to adapt its angle and scope along the way. Even so, you try to find the best possible solution to meet your goals and satisfy your customers.

While researching my upcoming book, How Product Designers Work, I’ve broken the complex, varied product creation process down into 4 essential steps. These steps provide the framework for the next lessons:

## 1. Hunt, hypothesize, synthesize
Products begin and end with your customers’ joys and pains. Coming up with product ideas that’ll work revolves around defining these 2 things. Defining them accurately guarantees you’ll discover a need your competitors aren’t fulfilling—or have overlooked entirely.

## 2. Build
Designing the product’s interface starts with actually designing the interface, creating and analyzing user flows, building prototypes, and evolving the interface on top of the prototype. As you approach product launch, this phase will bring your product more into focus as fidelity increases from testing feedback.

## 3. Test and level up
You’ll have to travel down a long road of refinement before each product release. You’ll refine based on feedback from your team, friends, family, outside beta testers, or even customers. You’ll learn how to take this feedback—good and bad—and soldier on. In this section, we’ll examine how to gather feedback and interpret it. You’ll also learn the early warning signs that you’re building the wrong product, and come to understand the role of feedback in “leveling up” your product.

## 4. Launch, monitor, and start over
How do you know when to ship? How do you prepare for launch? You’ll learn why it’s essential that you take special care of every aspect of your product at this stage. You’re the CEO of your product. You need to know how it works, what stage it’s in, what issues are open, and what’s next—at all times. And **your responsibility doesn’t end once the product has shipped**.

In this section, you’ll learn how to handle the “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) and how quickly you’ve built something vs. the quality and efficiency of the product. We’ll compare this to the notion of “minimum lovable products”—the simplest form of a product that people will see as a problem solver or bringer of joy—with the understanding that it’s not without flaws. Finally, you’ll learn what to monitor after the euphoria has worn off, and how to stay both sane and creative in the trough of despair.

I can’t give you a recipe for how to make a successful product or satisfy a customer, because building a product depends on a multitude of factors. The market you’re in. The people you work with. The biases you and your team have.

What this series can do, though, is present examples of successful work being done and provide frameworks or principles you can bring to your own work. Rather than be a simple series of do’s and don’ts, I want to take you on **a journey through the creation of a product through the eyes of experienced product designers**.

## Action items
* Succinctly identify your product’s audience. If you have trouble doing this—or if it’s “everyone”—it’ll be useful both to you and your company to refocus for whom your product is intended. Isolate the most promising segments who have the most pain and who have money they’re willing to spend.
* Succinctly name your audience’s core pains and concerns. Identify their daily habits. Outline how your product fits into their life.
* Isolate a major problem that your product and your company faces. Gather all of the internal metrics and departmental challenges (marketing, sales, engineering, etc.) to solving it, and unshackle yourself from the barriers of internal thinking. Work on ways to solve this problem and bring delight to your customers outside of normal working hours in the form of a prototype.
