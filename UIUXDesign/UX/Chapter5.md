# What are personas and why are they important?

User experience personas represent users of a product. They’re composed of factual information derived from qualitative and quantitative research presented in a profile format to help ground product strategy decisions and requirements in real user needs.

Through research, personas help define the top 3-5 groups of users by identifying themes in usage, needs, and priorities.

Say you need personas for a mobile banking app: one group of people prioritizes quickly transferring money to facilitate unexpected purchases, while other folks are mostly interested in ATM locations near their current location because they travel frequently.

These differing priorities represent the start of 2 different personas. Knowing this at the outset of a project helps navigate decision making to ensure your product is user-centric.

Creating personas during the insight research phase is the best way to help instill a user-centric approach that can be shared out and adopted by all project resources.

To do this, prioritize these deliverables early in the process to establish the expectation that all decisions will be rooted in the insights presented in the persona. By creating factual personas, you’ll be able to constantly refer back to the needs and goals outlined to quickly defuse disagreements and churn on approach. The decision maker is no longer someone on the project team—it’s the user.

Additionally, projects become stressful as timelines and budget are strained. Inevitably, there will be unexpected changes in requirements, or a need to revert on a decision. **Understand the needs of your users via personas to quickly make decisions to reduce stress**, potentially eliminating the need for endless meetings or escalations.

We’ve talked a lot about factual personas. It’s not uncommon, however, to run across false personas that have been created in a vacuum without research. You’ll know them when you see them.

At face value, these “stock photo personas” will look impressive, but dig further and there’s not much behind said photo and made-up name, demographic information, and salary information.

Move on—they won’t help you make meaningful decisions that will impress your actual users. They won’t help you have empathy for your users. They won’t help you increase sales, usage, or profitability. This type of effort perpetuates the “UX in a silo” mentality that further removes users from the decision-making process.

This chapter will focus on the basic elements that make up personas. This isn’t a detailed step-by-step instruction for each step. Further, we’ll explore mental models and the impacts they have on your product decisions.

## Creating personas
The overall process to create user personas is straightforward. However, the detailed work behind them isn’t a small task. Here are the general steps to creating a persona:

1. Interview users
2. Discover patterns and group together
3. Create models based on each group, incorporating the details below as necessary
4. Share with all project resources
5. Refer to each persona when any decision is needed

User personas comprise a number of data elements to help drive product decisions. We’ll walk through each element and why it’s important to the persona. While this isn’t an exhaustive list, it represents the basics.

## Qualitative insight
**Qualitative insight is the emotional 'why' of how a user interacts with your product.** Marry this with the “what” of quantitative data. You may have the data to understand that users abandon a cart flow on step 3 of 5 75% of the time, but that information doesn’t give you the why.

By conducting user research, you can begin to understand things like user behaviors, needs, influences, mental models, pain points, routines, opinions, and emotions. These elements may pertain to your product, but they also may be more broad than that. That research will be the basis for the persona.

## Goal(s)
Through interviews and contextual inquiries, you’ll uncover numerous goals that various users want to realize through using your product. They could be broad, or they could be specific to individual tasks. This information forms the basis for your different personas and is some of the most important on the persona. As you work through the project lifecycle, you’ll return to each persona to ensure the decisions you’re making will allow each persona to achieve their specific goal(s).

## Persona identifier
* Name
* Role
* Photo

Why name a persona if it’s supposed to represent a broad set of users with the same task goals? My recommendation: **provide a unique identifier for each persona** so internal resources can quickly differentiate which persona is being referred to. The identifier can range from the primary role for that persona, to fictional names, and perhaps even a photo. This exercise is most simply recommended.

## Descriptor and scenario
This is included to provide insight into information about the actual users that make up this persona and helps humanize the persona.

The descriptor can contain biographical and situational information based on actual users, quotes directly from users, and more. Why is this persona interested in locating ATMs quickly? Do the large majority travel for work at least 50% of the time? How does this affect how they interact with your product?

## Attitudes or behaviors
**Through user interviews, you’ll understand how users perceive your product.** Take a health insurance enrollment website: are users forced to use this because of their employer but struggle with completing even simple goals? Understanding these elements will help your product teams build empathy with users—and hopefully make improvements.

**Attitudes don’t have to be negative to be effective.** Perhaps you run a boutique ecommerce site with a devoted following. You’ll want to understand what’s driving this devotion so you can capitalize on it and increase revenue.

## Quantitative insight
Hard numbers make up quantitative insight. Factual truths that cannot be argued. Information can be results from a range of inputs: A/B testing, surveys, click-path analysis, demographics, revenue by segment, and more. This information should be included, for example, to support how each persona does or doesn't interact with your product or how much they do or do not spend.

Combining click-path analysis with revenue per transaction by persona group can help support the need to invest in revising the experience. If abandon rates are high, there’s a potential to dramatically increase revenue. Understanding and communicating this type of information should not be reserved for financial analysts or product managers alone. Marrying UX to this insight can be a powerful tool to increase UX maturity in your organization.

## Mental models
User experience mental models are the beliefs and assumptions users have about your product and how they expect it to work.

To illustrate, as newer cars switch to start-button ignitions in place of traditional key ignitions, drivers of the latter must change their mental model—or buy a different car if they want to drive it. The mental model is that drivers expect to open the door, sit down, insert the key, turn, release, and start driving.

While it may seem simple, replacing “insert the key, turn, release” with “push a button” requires change and adaptability, a whole new mental model.

Perhaps a more obvious illustration is Facebook. You’ve undoubtedly heard the uproar from friends or family when they change a feature. But what you’re hearing is the collective obliteration of millions of mental models. Because humans tend to be resistant to change, it’s important to discover mental models and use that understanding to either meet those expectations or to appropriately inform and train users when you deliver something that differs from their expectations.

***How are they formed?***

A mental model is formed based on the collective input of a variety of experiences. People don’t typically recognize that these models exist—and they certainly don’t classify them as mental models—but they expect all websites to operate the same.

While that sounds astonishing, it’s completely understandable because it’s unlikely that most users of your product exclusively use just your website or application. And because product and UX resources tend to like to innovate and invent new ways to solve the same problem, users are bombarded with numerous ends to the same mean.

As users navigate these different flows and structures, they develop an understanding of how they think something should work. They’re likely to hold beliefs about every detail and touchpoint they have with your product. Everything from brand colors, images, and typography, to the tone of content, your navigation structure, and where they find the contact link. Does your brand have digital, physical, and haptic experiences? They all come into play.

***What do I do?***

There are 2 main approaches to uncovering mental models: proactive and reactive. Meaning you understand the model before you launch a product to ensure there are no issues, or, for example, site analytics inform you that abandon rates are high and you’re losing revenue. If the latter is true, focus immediate attention where revenue is lost. Just be sure to return to do a full exercise to uncover potential issues elsewhere in your experience.

More tactically, through user research—interviews, usability test, and/or contextual inquiry—discover how users expect to use your product and document this in a flow or similar structure. This is a mental model.

Next, evaluate those findings compared to the actual flow for your experience. If there’s a difference, you probably have a breakdown in mental models.
 
If such a breakdown exists, do you need to immediately change the structure of your system to align? Not necessarily—this is where you get to make a call.

One option is to change whatever issue is causing the breakdown by aligning your system to your users’ mental model.

The other is to maintain the system and train users to adopt a new mental model.

The world needs a healthy dose of each.

Getting back to innovation, if we allowed our fears of disrupting the expected to kill advancement, you wouldn't be reading this book on a computer. Entire careers and businesses wouldn’t exist—the world would be a very different place.

But don’t use that as an excuse to ignore users’ expectations and expect them to respond positively. Help them along the journey to creating a new mental model.

A fantastic example occurred during the creation of the first mobile, touch-only apps. Because this was an almost entirely new form factor, mental models were colliding all over the place. Well-designed apps started to insert cue screens upon app launch to outline where navigation was and how to use gesture-based navigation. They were training a new mental model.

When properly understood, **mental models are powerful tools that can help business be more successful** while moving users closer to the decision-making seat.

## Takeaways
* Personas need to be factual and rooted in actual user research
* Personas can help reduce churn and disagreements when they're widely adopted
* Mental models are formed from a multitude of inputs
* Mental models can be changed
