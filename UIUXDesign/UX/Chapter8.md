# Presenting and participating in UX reviews
 
**Presenting and reviewing work is central to the UX creation process.** The UX presenter has a unique challenge of balancing advocating for end users with securing approval from project stakeholders who are likely funding the project.

Ideally, these 2 entities are aligned in delivering user-centric work, but that’s not always the case — **even incredibly thought-out work can fail if it isn’t effectively presented**.

What does a successful presentation look like?

How is it conducted?

How do you participate and provide relevant feedback?

Whose ideas are the best to implement?

This chapter will split participant and presenter into 2 audiences—and it’ll explain specific approaches for each.

## Participant
If you’re participating in a UX review, you're likely a subject matter expert, project stakeholder, or client—you're there for a reason. The most important thing to remember is that **in a user-centric organization, user insight and research drives UX decisions**, not a group of people in a conference room reviewing UX work on a screen or projector. While you may hold final approval power, the user should be at the forefront of all of those decisions.

As a participant, you should not allow a “grand reveal” review meeting, which happens when a project kicks off and then weeks, or even months, go by without reviewing the work-in-progress.

As a stakeholder, you should be part of the ongoing creation process, providing insight and feedback along the way. Ensuring this approach is adopted by project teams can help reduce revisions and wasted time and money.

**Feedback is central to the UX process.** UX professionals gather feedback from almost everyone—and project stakeholders and clients aren’t exempt from that.

Remember, though, that **user feedback and successful adoption is the ultimate feedback**. Appropriately delivering your feedback and point of view can give project resources important insight to revise that work.

* **Deliver feedback positively**: most work environments are already stressful, so why add to that environment through negative feedback? Be cognizant of approach, delivery, and tone of voice. UX is a passion for most professionals. Work is taken very seriously—and, in some cases, personally. You don’t need to walk on glass, but don’t be rude.  
* **Suggest, don't demand**: by delivering feedback as a mandate, you run the risk of shutting down collaboration and effective idea iteration. By framing delivery as an idea, it keeps communication open and will lead to more effective collaboration.
* **Receive rationale, provide rationale**: a strong UX team will either deliver UX rationale for decisions as part of the presentation or will provide it immediately when prompted. As you deliver suggestions, afford them the same and provide rationale for your idea.

Being an active, positive participant and approver of UX deliverables is a powerful role. It’s easy to allow personal ideas to drive your recommendations. Through implementing a user-centric approach to projects, you can help be an advocate for all users. By adopting the approaches outlined above you can be a facilitator of positive collaboration.

## Presenter
When presenting UX work, you have 2 goals to balance: being the voice and advocate for your user, and securing approval from project stakeholders. This balancing act requires patience, resilience, and quick-on-your-feet communication skills.

The most important element of presenting work isn't waiting until you feel work is final to do so. **A review or approval meeting shouldn’t be the first time project teams see work.**

As an industry, **we need to eradicate the ‘grand reveal’ approach to reviews and approval**. We need to actually collaborate and not just talk about it.

So what does that look like? In its most basic approach, adopt a strong work-in-progress culture where you frequently share ideas, concepts, or sketches with all project resources to solicit feedback and discover feasibility. By opening up your process, you create a stronger sense of ownership of the solution and reduce the possibility of multiple rounds of revisions.

The following approaches will help ensure you conduct the best possible review meeting:

* **Prepare**: regardless of your years of experience, preparing for a presentation can help you navigate challenging questions and be better prepared to keep the flow of the meeting on track. Create a quick outline and run through what you plan to present at least a couple of times to test different approaches and responses. If you're new to presenting, practice with core team members that are close to the work so they can help flesh out your main points.
* **Be extemporaneous**: don’t read the screen or tell attendees what they can see themselves. They’ll quickly lose focus and switch their attention to mobile phones, emails, or to another task on their plate.
* **Deliver rationale**: you’ve made dozens or even hundreds of decisions to get to the point of presenting, so be sure those decisions are documented so you can easily communicate them to the group. You should expect questions and suggestions that may differ from the approach you're recommending. Possessing solid rationale rooted in user insight or feedback is a powerful tool to keep your recommendations on track.
* **Be in control**: communicate an agenda from the outset and set expectations about how the meeting will progress. If you want to present first and then open the floor for conversation, have your attendees document questions throughout and let you present in entirety. Once you’ve set expectations, maintain that control to keep the meeting focused to achieve all tasks.
* **Tackle feedback positively**: when it comes to UX, there’s no shortage of opinions. Ideally in user-centric organizations, opinions don’t have a place in product development decisions. But that’s not always the case. As a presenter, you’ll likely have to react to ideas ranging from genuine feedback to poorly delivered mandates. Your job is to react to all ideas and keep a level tone to maintain a positive meeting. While there will be occasions that UX decisions need to bend to the whims of strong mandates, always try to root feedback and rationale in user research insights and feedback.

When presenting work, your most important role is being an advocate for users. **Users rely on you to provide rationale rooted in their feedback** to deliver a product they want to use.
