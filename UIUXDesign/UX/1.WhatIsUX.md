# What is User Experience

Those who’ve heard about UX and want to know what it is, why it’s so important, and how to become an advocate for it: this e-course is just for you.

Companies are starting to realize the importance of centering their products and experiences around the user. They’re investing in professionals who can get UX practices off the ground and refocus their business approach.

So what exactly is UX, and how do you explain it to people? Good question. There are endless theoretical and academic explanations, but I believe ***true art lies with constraint and brevity***.

The simplest explanation I’ve seen:

*You know when you’re using a website, an app, or your phone and you get frustrated when it doesn't do what you want it to? My job is to make sure that doesn't happen.*

You know when you’re using a website, an app, or your phone and you get frustrated when it doesn't do what you want it to? My job is to make sure that doesn't happen.
 
I’ve used this to successfully explain my complex, confusing job to everybody—even the hopelessly clueless. As a non-practitioner, every aspect of UX should be explained to you in this manner.

But if you’re receiving bloated explanations, work with your practitioner-partner to get to a simpler understanding. Your business depends on it.

Software product development isn’t new. The decades-old platform revolutionized business and how customers interact with companies. Both job roles and customer processes have dramatically shifted to online platforms.

Unfortunately, there hasn’t been enough focus on usability and the customer experience. ***Most websites and apps create more frustrating experiences than delightful ones.***

So even as companies start to meaningfully invest in UX, and even as the growing swell towards delivering products that are far more than ***simply usable*** is well underfoot, we need more voices.

UX practitioners have been and will continue to beat this drum—and now’s the time for those of you on the outside to join the chorus. The following information about the tenets of UX are brought to you on the shoulders of people who’ve advocated for UX inclusion at a variety of agencies and companies of all sizes to varying degrees of success. They’re tested and true methods, and adopting any semblance will move the needle of UX maturity at your organization ever closer to ideal.

And what’s that ideal? It’s the full embodiment of what I like to call ***the unwritten vow that UX practitioners assume: be unapologetic advocates for all users***.

It’s time everyone adopted this vow and assumed the role of **UX advocate**. Users need your voice.

## UX maturity

UX maturity is a measurement mechanism that allows you to understand how likely an organization is to implement a user-centered approach to product development.

Being familiar with UX maturity and how to assess it within an organization is central to understanding UX.

After the initial assessment, monthly or quarterly reviews can be conducted to understand if maturity is trending higher, lower, or the same. Maturity modeling is a powerful tool that can help outline the realities of how UX approaches are either being implemented or received.

The following personas outline 4 variations of UX maturity, and they’re applicable to individuals or entire organizations.

## Barrier persona

### Overview

Conversations regarding implementing user-centered approaches are a non-starter. Efforts are completely shut down and not welcome. In a small organization there may not be many paths forward, while in larger organizations you can try to locate other individuals to help join the cause. Don’t give up, but don’t overly invest either—cut your losses and move on if the writing’s on the wall.

### Pushback

Common pushback from an organization in the barrier model:
* Not having the time in project timelines to allow for additional work
* Not having the appropriate funding to invest in resources
* Clients who aren’t supportive of or interested in a UX approach
* The most fatal pushback of “We’ve always done it this way, it works, and we don't need to change it.”

### Overcoming

The most successful approaches to improve UX maturity in the barrier model incrementally produce UX artifacts that don’t disrupt project timelines. Produce a user flow based on traditional business requirements to demonstrate the requested flow and a better, proposed flow that reduces task completion time. Presenting this to project stakeholders in a positive manner can help demonstrate how approaching projects with user-centered thinking produces positive results.

## Apprehensive persona

### Overview

Conversations are no longer non-starters, but implementation is sporadic. There’s likely a small number of supportive individuals, but barriers still outnumber them. Unfamiliarity and unwillingness to implement UX approaches typically happen at the leadership level. Regardless, there’s likely a small number of dedicated UX professionals, depending on the size of the organization.

### Pushback

The barrier and apprehensive personas share some commonality. Incremental UX artifacts have started to prove their usefulness, and perhaps some project partners may even be requesting research, flows, or wireframes.

Be careful to not just cater to individual advocate’s projects. It'll feel easier to do so because some parts of the UX process have been implemented, but focusing solely on the easy path won’t grow UX maturity across the company.

Regardless of these successful efforts, there are still numerous instances of pushback regarding funding and timelines.

### Overcoming

Continuing the incremental efforts outlined in the barrier persona is vital—and you should marry those with success stories.

Tie UX artifacts to improved business processes, a reduction in task completion time, or an increase in revenue. Hard benefits may be difficult to come by without detailed metrics, but outlining soft benefits is still beneficial. In order to grow maturity to the next level, focus should be placed on expanding the breadth of the UX process in established projects and continuing to break down barriers that are still resistant.  

## Supportive persona

### Overview

Things are going well—very well. Adoption of the UX process extends beyond a small percentage of total projects, and people are reaching out to request UX artifacts for a wide variety of projects.

Grassroots efforts with individuals throughout the company have paid off, and now it’s time to focus upwards. It’s usually necessary to arrive at a point where a top-down mandate, coupled with grassroots efforts, is needed to jump to the next level.

### Pushback

Pockets of barrier and apprehensive behavior will continue to exist. Efforts previously outlined have proven successful, so be certain to fall back on those tried and true approaches.

Individuals in the C-suite are likely aware of the UX process, but they’re not at the point where they’re strong advocates or willing to alter their entire approach to business.

The most common situation found in the supportive persona is that a while a wide variety of people are aware of UX, they likely don’t make it a priority. While UX artifacts may be created as part of the overall project process, a user-centered approach isn’t driving project and business strategy.

### Overcoming

Because things are going well, you may think that people or companies should progress rapidly from the supportive persona to the advocate persona. This misconception can lead to frustration, especially if you’ve grown maturity from the barrier or apprehensive persona. Focus on the bottom-up and top-down approach to effect larger change.

## Advocate

### Overview

The ideal state. Product roadmaps, project strategy, and business decisions are driven by UX or user-centered approaches. Individuals in the C-suite aren’t just familiar with the basics of UX—they understand the UX lifecycle in great detail and advocate at almost every juncture.

Note that while the organization as whole may fit a different persona, individuals will almost certainly fit other, more advanced personas. The resources will be vital to grow overall UX maturity.

### Pushback

Pushback is virtually non-existent. Be aware of resource transitions and turnover. It may be likely that people new to UX-driven organization won’t have had that experience in their career. Be careful not to preach to them. Instead rely on assessing their individual UX maturity and make a plan to get them up to speed.

## Re-purposing

The world of UX is extremely collaborative, as evidenced by how we approach the experiences we create and how we share knowledge via blogs, e-courses, conferences, and shared files.

Only recently have academic degrees in UX been a reality. We’re an amalgamation of user advocates with varied backgrounds: graphic designers, developers, engineers, architects, actors, and artists, to name only a few.

We share. We borrow. We help each other out. I fully expect you to take bits and pieces from this e-course and use them in your own efforts. In fact, I implore you to.

On that note, some approaches in this e-course are adapted from a number of brilliant practitioners. Those are appropriately noted.

**Now go forth and repurpose.**

In the next chapter, we'll discuss UX as a practice and the roles that make it up.
