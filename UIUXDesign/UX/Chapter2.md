# UX as a practice and the roles that make it up

* User experience designer
* Visual designer
* User experience architect
* Information architect
* User experience strategist
* Interaction designer
* Unicorn

Confused yet? That’s not even an exhaustive list.

Confusion about which role does what isn't helping the UX movement.

**Approaching UX as a practice made up of specific disciplines creates clarity and hierarchy.** UX is the practice: strategy, user research, information architecture, and visual design make up each discipline. Titles follow suit, so there’s no confusion about who does what.

This approach also helps with assessing UX maturity. When your organization falls lower on the scale, it’s likely that not all disciplines are engaged in a project. It’s typical that flow and wireframes are some of the first UX artifacts implemented. This represents fairly low UX maturity.

Like we talked about in the last chapter, the backgrounds of individuals making up each of these disciplines is diverse. You’ll likely run across specialists that focus on one vertical.

Conversely, you may run into practitioners that are able to wear many hats and function across multiple silos. It’s currently popular to call these people unicorns, gurus, or hybrids.

**A true multidisciplinary practitioner typically doesn’t subscribe to titles like 'unicorn.'** Someone who does might be the antithesis to the collaborative, community-focused individual that UX is built upon.

Here’s a hint: **move on if you have a guru, ninja, or the like in your organization**.

Perhaps the biggest myth that exists with various UX roles within the practice is that a company can hire a single “UX person” to work through all of these functions. Regardless of project size, it’s just not acceptable to hire one person to complete all functions.

Even resources that are multi-disciplinary usually only specialize across 2 disciplines. An organization’s willingness to invest in a full UX practice is a direct input to their UX maturity assessment.

## UX strategy

For too long, most UX work has been reactive, meaning the project is usually well underway before UX practitioners engage. Or worse, they engage after a substantial financial investment on an already-launched product. Certain aspects of the app and startup cultures have aided in the groundswell to move UX earlier in the project, product, and company planning lifecycle. But more needs to be done.

This is where a UX strategist comes in. UX strategists are a natural complement to product strategists, marketing planners, brand strategists, and other more “typical” functions that define roadmaps and approaches to business and product definition.

**UX strategists must engage and deliver heavily early on**—effort will taper off as the project moves through research and into information architecture, visual design, development, and launch. The approaches they define should be constantly referred to.

Deploying the UX strategy to drive these early conversations and decisions will ensure that roadmaps, business and behavior goals, performance indicators, desired outcomes, and potential roadblocks are appropriately outlined and followed through the entirety of the project. Behavioral goals tied to business goals are defined at the outset. These are the benchmarks that the entire team should adhere to—especially in the 11th hour when concessions are being made to meet timelines.

Goals are your contract, and securing approval from product/business owners gives you the leverage you need to push the team to make the right decisions, even if that means pushing timelines. **Extra time upfront to gather consensus saves stress in the long run.**

Pushback to this role is common, and it’s among the most difficult to implement into an organization. This is because it’s the most similar role to other strategic roles, and resources may feel as though their responsibilities are being usurped by adding a UX strategist. Be sure to outline that this strategy is a complement to other strategy resources.

## User research

If all UX practitioners and advocates vow to be relentless advocates for all users, then the user researcher is the actualization of this voice. After all, *how can you create user-centered products without hearing from the user?*

**Without research, UX isn’t UX.** If your company is delivering products without listening to users’ voices, they’re doing a great disservice to both the company and the users.

The core responsibility of a researcher is to engage with potential and actual users of a product in order to understand how they interact with the experience, and whether it works well or has opportunities to improve.

Information is gathered in support of assumptions or used to alter the experience towards what users are requesting. There are a number of research methodologies that can be employed depending on the type of feedback needed, the timeline, and the budget.

There are 2 ways to engage user research:

* At the outset of the project to drive product strategy
* After the product launches

**It’s ideal to drive product strategy based on research before work starts.** Gathering feedback after a product launches is also beneficial, but in order to make changes, previously made decisions on business, UX, and engineering have to be reverted and relaunched.

User research is doubly the most difficult part of the practice to be approved and the first to get cut when budget or timeline discussions get serious, confounding as it as. The common misconception is that research is costly and time is intensive.

The reality is that user research can be completely scaled to match the budget and timing at end.

## Information architect

Information architects (IA) are part designer, part developer, part strategist. **Information architects inherently drive order from chaos.** Dig around in a workspace of an IA, and you’ll likely find pens and markers organized by color and various types of Post-it notes stacked just so. It’s fitting, as practitioners in this discipline use organizational tools such as site maps, user flows, and task flows and logical process thinking to organize experiences.

The role of the IA spans many disciplines and requires broad experience. As an IA works through business goals and requirements to define the structure of an experience, they have to understand design and hierarchy principles to appropriately structure the page. They also need to understand code to decipher how APIs and front-end technologies impact the experience. And they have to understand content to convey the intention of headlines, buttons, and other content areas.

The IA discipline is also usually responsible for the first visualization of what was previously only verbally discussed concepts outlined via strategy and requirements documents. It can be equally exciting and contentious as business and stakeholders are brought into initial reviews. IAs can avoid this by facilitating co-sketching sessions with the same audience. Through this process, sketching out the potential experience will allow a larger group to directly contribute and have more ownership in UX decisions.

IA artifacts are generally easier to implement than other disciplines because they can be derived as the most beneficial. It’s not uncommon for more traditionally focused design companies to be apprehensive towards design, as traditional designers misconstrue wireframes as taking away design control.

## UX visual designer

This should be pretty self explanatory, right? Designers, well, *design*. They make things pretty and paint the walls, if you will.

This is a common generalization for an essential part of the process. **Design is more than picking a font and imagery**, or making everything look pretty. Applying solid design principles to an experience can be directly connected to the success or failure of it. Have you ever been using an application and there are 5 buttons with the same color applied, but one is submit and the rest are less important? **Lack of hierarchy in conjunction with color theory causes confusion.**

The basics of design include balance, harmony, hierarchy, and color theory. A designer’s tools include font families (weights and sizes), color, illustration, and imagery. Seemingly abstract principles to a non-practitioner but central to every decision a visual designer makes—and more pervasive in your life than you may realize.

Every color, line, button, and font of a well-designed application has reasoning, rationale, and hours of iteration behind it. All to make sure you don't realize those decisions or why they were made.

**Great design is truly invisible. It just exists.**

Indeed visual designers labor over the differences between a 70% versus 80% black line. The former may not create a strong enough delineation between sections, but the latter is too strong and jumps off of the page. Balance between that line, whitespace, and other content on the screen must come together to create a harmonious experience.

Branding, logo creation, and art direction are additional design functions that come together to create a strong experience presence. Much like we’ve dispelled the myth that you can hire a single “UX person” to do 5 or more jobs, a UX visual designer may not be a brand creator or strong at creating logos. And they’re not likely to feel comfortable art directing a photo or video shoot.

Specialized experts within each of these design functions need to be activated based on your need. It wouldn’t make much business sense to invest in a strong UX approach for your new responsive website without supporting that with a compelling and relevant brand design and strategy.

Strong UX visual designers can, however, be responsible for interpreting brand direction as they design the application you’re launching.

## Collaboration

It’s impossible to address UX as a practice and the disciplines that make it up without talking about collaboration—it’s central to delivering products.

Breaking down silos and opening up experience development to all roles is frankly the only approach that will result in differentiated products. For example, just because a project is in the strategy phase doesn’t mean that the researcher or visual designer should be excluded.

Weekly or daily collaboration sessions are vital for all roles to share progress and review work at all stages. In the creative field, “work-in-progress” tends to be a bad word. There’s an obsession around unveiling the solution fully-baked like the opening night of a Broadway show.
 
**We need to get away from the big reveal.** There’s immense value in exposing the work, the messy interim, and opening up the debate and collaboration around competing ideas to all roles.

Debate strategy briefs to further refine behavior goals that will drive all project decisions. Review user flows to work through approaches to application structure and process. Perform time-boxed sketching sessions to work through wireframe approaches. Have all roles create mood and feature boards to provide as inputs into visual design.

Building this comfort with collaboration within the UX practice will result in better experiences. The logical next step is to expand this collaboration to partner teams. There’s a common attitude towards UX teams that they disappear after the kickoff and come back later with a solution. The most severe offense is defining a solution that doesn’t take into account development constraints. What’s also missed is the ability to leverage additional ideas as functionality is defined via various UX deliverables.
