# UX Visual Design

The design field encompasses a wide variety of disciplines for purposes of user experience. This chapter focuses on the visual design of user interfaces. There are still professionals who do traditional graphic design, marketing design, brand design, type design, and more.

Focusing specifically on the design of user interfaces, designers employ the basics of design approaches to create compelling experiences that engage and captivate users.

Website and application development has a deep relationship with visual design. Long before full user experience practices were implemented to make experiences more usable, designers were influencing developers and companies in an attempt to elevate the sophistication of the web.

Early in the web design explosion, companies largely jumped directly to visual design, skipping over other critical functions of UX that were still being invented and defined. This led to designs that were sometimes impressive, but mostly suffered from critical usability issues. This was mostly a result of clients not understanding flows or wireframes and not being interested in seeing or approving anything but the pretty pictures.

While this is less prevalent as UX maturity advances as a whole, this practice should be avoided at almost every cost because it doesn’t result in user-centric products. That’s not to say design can’t start until all other UX artifacts are complete — **design should start early and be iterative**.

Also, very early web or interactive designers often wore many hats in an attempt to organize content into a consumable format. As a result, the UX industry still suffers from the misconception that one or 2 resources can create all aspects of the experience. Even with a small-scope project, it’s unlikely that a single resource can do research, create personas, work through information architecture, create prototypes, and deliver visual design.

As websites and applications shifted from brochure websites to doing critical business functions via the web, usability grew in seriousness and visual design became part of a larger user experience practice. That, coupled with UX maturity slowing growing across the board, is resulting in a quiet movement that minimizes visual design to only making the experience pretty.

As teams deliver research insights, personas, flows, wireframes, and more, design timelines become crunched and designers can be relegated to only applying a color here, picking out an image there, and defining a few type styles. The juxtaposition of jumping directly to visual design a few years ago, to simply applying colors now is a rapid and concerning direction.

**Design is as important to usability as every other function of UX.** Through the act of applying color, selecting typography, manipulating content, and picking imagery, the designer creates balance, structure, and hierarchy, and they define the visual flow of an application or website. These choices draw a user in and maintain engagement through visual narration. Without the appropriate design choices, user research, mental model creation, and information architecture, work can be quickly negated. If the design choices don’t resonate with the user within seconds—or even sub-seconds—they’ll leave.

This chapter will focus on the basic design principles and deliverables a visual designer creates.

## Visual design
Visual design is the definition and orchestration of color, typography, content, grid layout, and hierarchy to visually depict what an experience will look like. Most designers work through multiple iterations and concepts before arriving at the final design, even if a single wireframe concept was developed.

The choices made in each of these unique designs are made to be in harmony with each other for that particular concept. It’s common for stakeholders in non-user-centric organizations to exert opinions and ideas to combine concepts in a practice called *frankensteining*, something that’s dangerous without conducting user research because the experience starts to be designed for the stakeholders, not the users.

Design mockups are based off of wireframes but don’t need to strictly adhere to wireframes. When designers start to make design choices, the layout and structure defined in wireframes may not be as successful. It’s vital to communicate this to all resources so there are no surprises during design handoffs.

While all UX deliverables provide direction to development teams, visual designs perhaps represent the largest. Depending on the structure of your company, front-end development resources may reside on a UX team, or they may be a separate team or company altogether. Defining the type of handoff documentation required early in the process is important to understand impacts to timelines.

* **Original design file handoff**: most front-end developers only require PSD handoff to start their work. This is the fastest, most efficient way to deliver design files to partners.
* **Style guides**: sometimes full style guides that define type styles, spacing, etc. are required to hand off to third party or offshore teams. Because collaboration may not be possible, extreme detail is required. This type of deliverable adds considerable time to the project. Further, when collaboration isn’t possible, ideas and approaches can be lost in translation. Ensure documentation is as specific as possible to avoid these issues.  
* **Component kits**: useful because they aggregate all possible design elements (buttons, type styles, icons, etc.) into a single file for quick review and direction.

## Hierarchy
Hierarchy is one of the most important design elements designers use to create the visual narrative of an experience. Hierarchy is the definition and ranking—by importance—of all elements in an experience: what you see first, second, third, and so on. Through definition of size, shape, color, weight, and balance, designers create a visual flow that they want a user to follow. There’s a lack of hierarchy when an experience has multiple elements competing for the slot of highest importance.

Hierarchy definition is important to users and businesses alike. Businesses have specific elements they want users to recognize to drive revenue, and users usually have a specific item they need or want to find on your website. Working with mental models, designers can help meet the needs of both.

## Design prototype
A design prototype is used to test out design interaction concepts, conduct concept validation research, and lead review/approval sessions with project resources and stakeholders. By leveraging a number of quick prototype tools, designs can be easily exported to facilitate collaboration and reviews. Layering in realistic drop-down, modal, swipe gestures, and other navigation basics will help reviewers interact with design concepts in a more realistic experience.

Historically, designs have been reviewed via static PDFs or individual JPEGs, resulting in a poor user experience for user research and stakeholder reviews. It’s not uncommon for website and application designs to be printed off for review. This approach doesn’t represent how users will interact with the final product by replacing paper with screen or touch + screen interaction, which should be largely avoided.

## Design language
Design language creation documents a set of elements central to design in order to create consistency across all experience properties. When companies only had a single website, it was easy to ensure buttons were consistent across pages. As the number of properties rapidly expand to email, social, mobile apps, and sometimes numerous websites, it’s easy to create contradictory and confusing flows and design. This problem is further confounded in large organizations with multiple properties. In those scenarios, it’s likely that disparate UX and development resources are producing work that the user will interact with in a single experience.

## Takeaways
* Design isn’t overtly handcuffed to wireframe definition. Further exploration and change can be necessary as design elements are applied.
* As experience properties for a company increase, maintain consistency through design language definition.

In the next chapter, we'll discuss presenting and participating in UX reviews.
